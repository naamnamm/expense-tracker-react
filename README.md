## Summary

This is the first React App I've created. Learning/Using React for the first time has been quite challenging at times. Once things started to sink in, I really enjoyed it. Together with bootstrap, it's magic!

This app is primilary built with class-based components with states and passing the data down to children components with props. For my future react projects, I'm excited to explore more on life-cycle methods and functional components with hooks.
